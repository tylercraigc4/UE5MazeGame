# Overview

I made a simple maze game in Unreal Engine 5. The task is to touch the magic artifact at the end of the maze. I designed this game to explore some of Unreal Engine 5's new capabilites such as Lumen for real time lighting, reflections and shadows without ray tracing hardware and nanite which allows for billions of polygons in high resolution textures without performance degredation. *Note: I don't have any code here in github since the file size was too large. I have a walkthrough of the code on my Youtube video linked below.*

# Development Environment

I used the early access version of Unreal Engine 5 to make this game. I mainly used UE5 blueprints to program the functionality of sounds and interacting with the artifact. Using converting to and using C++ is also possible.
